# Hera+

For years women's healthcare concerns have been overlooked and dismissed. Hera+ is a healthcare triage app that empowers women by providing them with reports about their health before their medical appointments and recording these reports so women can track their medical history. Before appointments, users can answer a few preliminary questions about their symptoms, medical history, and target area and then conduct a body scan using Presage. Hera+ will then provide users with a report of their estimated vitals, ways to advocate for their health, and a summary of how their vital stats connect with the listed symptoms. Users can then download these reports and take them to their doctors appointments to help them with their medical discussions. Hera+ also keeps a log of the user's past scans which are time-stamped, so they can revisit past logs and track changes in their symptoms and stats.
